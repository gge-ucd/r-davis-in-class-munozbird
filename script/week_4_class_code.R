#Intro to Dataframes

download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169", destfile = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")  #Package will not know that to save the file as so have to specify

surveys <- read.csv(file = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")

head(surveys) #Prints first six observations of each column

# Each column in a data frame is a vector

#Looking at structure

str(surveys)

dim(surveys)
nrow(surveys) #Gives # of rows
ncol(surveys) #Gives # of columns

tail(surveys) #Prints last six observations of each column

names(surveys) #Character vector of all the columns in our survey
rownames(surveys)


# Another useful one
summary(surveys) # Good to check the data

#Subsetting dataframes

#subsetting vectors by giving them a location index
animal_vec <- c("mouse", "rat", "cat")
animal_vec[2]

#dataframes are 2D!
surveys[1,1] #first row, first column
head(surveys)
surveys[2,1]

surveys[1,6]

surveys[33000,1]

#whole first column as a VECTOR
surveys[,1] #leaving one of these dimensions blank means return everything from the selected dimension

#using a single number with no comma will give us a dataframe with one column
surveys[1]
head(surveys[1])

surveys[1:3,7]

# Pull out the first 3 vaues in the 6th columns

surveys[1:3,6]

#Pull our a whole single observation
surveys[5,]

#negative sign to exclude indices
surveys[1:5,-1]

surveys[-10:34786,]
#Error: Error in xj[i] : only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts

#workaround:
surveys[-c(10:34786),]

surveys[c(10,15,20),]
surveys[c(10,15,20,10),]
surveys[c(1,1,1,1,1),]

#more ways to subset
surveys["plot_id"] #single column as data.frame
surveys[,"plot_id"] #single column as vector
surveys[["plot_id"]] #single column as vector; gives same result as previous, but double-brackets come in handy when utilizing lists
surveys$year #Probably most commonly used; single column as vector


###CHALLENGE###

#Create a data.frame (surveys_200) containing only the data in row 200 of the surveys dataset.
surveys_200 <- surveys[200,]
surveys_200

#Notice how nrow() gave you the number of rows in a data.frame? Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame. Compare that with what you see as the last row using tail() to make sure itâ€™s meeting expectations.

nrow(surveys)   #34786
surveys[34786,]
tail(surveys)

#Pull out that last row using nrow() instead of the row number. Create a new data frame (surveys_last) from that last row.
surveys_last <- surveys[nrow(surveys),]
surveys_last

#Use nrow() to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named surveys_middle.
surveys_middle <- surveys[nrow(surveys)/2,]
surveys_middle

#Combine nrow() with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of head(surveys), keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.
surveys[-c(7:nrow(surveys)),]



# Finally, factors
# Represent categorical data. They are stored as integers with labels assigned to them. Can be ordered or unordered
surveys$sex

#Creating our own factor
sex <- as.factor(c("male", "female","female","male"))
sex

class(sex)  # tells us it is a factor; tells us higher level attribute of the item

typeof(sex) # tells is it is an integer

#Levels gives back a character vector of the levels
levels(sex)
levels(surveys$genus)

nlevels(sex)

concentration <- factor(c("high", "medium","high","low"))
concentration
# Want the levels to make sense
concentration <- factor(concentration, levels = c("low","medium","high"))
concentration

# Factors have idiosyncrasies
#Let's try adding to a factor
concentration <- c(concentration, "very high")
concentration
#Does not like this; Coerces to characters if you add a value that doesn't match a current level

#Let's just make them characters
as.character(sex)

#factors with numeric levels
year_factor <- factor(c(1990,1923,1965,2018))
as.numeric(year_factor)

as.character(year_factor)

#this will actually give us a numeric vector
as.numeric(as.character(year_factor))

#recommended way, "safer" than the previous
as.numeric(levels(year_factor))[year_factor]


#why the heck all the factors?
?read.csv

surveys_no_factors <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = F) #This will read in without factors
str(surveys_no_factors)

#renaming factors
sex <- surveys$sex
levels(sex) # We get three levels: F, M, and [Blank]
levels(sex)[1] <- "undetermined"
levels(sex)

#working with dates
install.packages("lubridate") #Generally do not have install.packages function in your code or can be annoying to collaborator
