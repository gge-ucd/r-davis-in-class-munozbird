#Read portal_data_joined.csv into R using the read.csv command and create a dataframe named surveys

#CHALLENGE: Select all rows that have a hindfoot_length greater than 32, save these in a new data.frame named surveys_long_feet, then plot its hindfoot_length values as a histogram using the hist function.

surveys_long_feet <- surveys_subset[(surveys_subset[,5]>32),]

#Change the column hindfoot_lengths into a character vector.
